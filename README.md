Objective: The objective of this task is to design and implement basic digital logic circuits, such as logic gates, adders, and multiplexers, using Verilog within a VLSI software environment. This involves creating the Verilog code, simulating the designs to verify their correct functionality, and using the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to analyze and validate the simulation results.

Key Activities:
1. Design Circuits Using Verilog: Write Verilog code for logic gates, adders, and multiplexers.
2. Set Up Simulation Environment: Configure VLSI software for simulation. And create testbenches for input stimuli.
3. Simulate Verilog Designs: Run simulations to test circuit functionality. And collect simulation data.
4. Analyze Simulation Results: Use waveform viewer to examine outputs. And Verify correct circuit behavior.
5. Debug and Optimize Designs: Identify and fix errors. And optimize Verilog code for performance.
6. Document the Process: Record design steps and results.And include final Verilog code.
7. Final Verification: Conduct final simulations to ensure design accuracy.

Technologies Used:
1. Verilog for designing digital circuits.
2. VLSI software tools (e.g., Cadence, Synopsys) for design and simulation.
3. Waveform viewers (e.g., ModelSim, SimVision) for analyzing outputs.
4. Simulation tools (e.g., VCS, NC-Verilog) for running tests.
5. Text editors/IDEs (e.g., Sublime Text, VS Code) for coding.
6. Debugging tools (e.g., DVE, SignalTap) for fixing issues.
